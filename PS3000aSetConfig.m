% Platform Specific Information:-
%
% Microsoft Windows: Download the Software Development Kit installer from
% the <a href="matlab: web('https://www.picotech.com/downloads')">Pico Technology Download software and manuals for oscilloscopes and data loggers</a> page.
% 
% Linux: Follow the instructions to install the libps3000a and libpswrappers
% packages from the <a href="matlab:
% web('https://www.picotech.com/downloads/linux')">Pico Technology Linux Software & Drivers for Oscilloscopes and Data Loggers</a> page.
%
% Apple Mac OS X: Follow the instructions to install the PicoScope 6
% application from the <a href="matlab: web('https://www.picotech.com/downloads')">Pico Technology Download software and manuals for oscilloscopes and data loggers</a> page.
% Optionally, create a 'maci64' folder in the same directory as this file
% and copy the following files into it:
% 
% * libps3000a.dylib and any other libps3000a library files
% * libps3000aWrap.dylib and any other libps3000aWrap library files
